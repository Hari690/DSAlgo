/**
 * Given a list of accounts where each element accounts[i] is a list of strings, where the first element accounts[i][0] is a name, and
 * the rest of the elements are emails representing emails of the account.
 *
 * Now, we would like to merge these accounts. Two accounts definitely belong to the same person if there is some common email to both
 * accounts. Note that even if two accounts have the same name, they may belong to different people as people could have the same name. A
 * person can have any number of accounts initially, but all of their accounts definitely have the same name.
 *
 * After merging the accounts, return the accounts in the following format: the first element of each account is the name, and the rest
 * of the elements are emails in sorted order. The accounts themselves can be returned in any order.
