/**
 * In a row of trees, the i-th tree produces fruit with type tree[i].
 *
 * You start at any tree of your choice, then repeatedly perform the following steps:
 *
 * Add one piece of fruit from this tree to your baskets.  If you cannot, stop.
 * Move to the next tree to the right of the current tree.  If there is no tree to the right, stop.
 * Note that you do not have any choice after the initial choice of starting tree: you must perform step 1, then step 2, then back to
 * step 1, then step 2, and so on until you stop.
 *
 * You have two baskets, and each basket can carry any quantity of fruit, but you want each basket to only carry one type of fruit each.
 * What is the total amount of fruit you can collect with this procedure?
 *
 * Input: [1,2,1]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can collect [1,2,1].
 *
 * Longest subarray with 2 elements
